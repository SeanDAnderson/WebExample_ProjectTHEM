    <h3>J. Harker<br>18 May</h3>
    <p class ="journal">
        I have been down to look at that room again in daylight, for I must know
        the truth. When I got to the doorway at the top of the stairs I found it
        closed. It had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the
        woodwork was splintered. I could see that the bolt of the lock had not 
        been shot, but the door is fastened from the inside. I fear it was no 
        dream, and must act on this surmise.
